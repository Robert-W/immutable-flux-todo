# immutable-flux-todo
Simple Todo App using Flux with ImmutableJS and React

#### Still Under Construction, Items Remaining
* Add History Panel for time travel functionality
* Add edit functionality to todo
* Add undo
* Add redo

### Getting Started

Install all dependencies with npm

`npm install`

Run `npm start` and go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

You can also use `npm run prod` to generate a production bundle under a `dist` folder.

### Purpose

This was just a proof of concept and learning experience.  I wanted to test some new build tools but more importantly, learn how to use [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) with [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) while writing in ES6. Some of the other libraries and tools used in this project include the following (not counting some gulp modules like stylus, etc.):
* [Alt](http://alt.js.org/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
